## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. Plotly libraries are used which can be installed using their official guidelines

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Netflix data made available from kaggle to better understand the content distribution of netflix:

1. What is the type of content available on netflix ?
2. What is the distribution of Netflix content along specific ratings
3. What are the major production sources for the netflix Content
4. What specific year content were released on Netflix
5. What specific years did netflix made more content available
6. What specific categories of content are present and which categories saw the relatively larger proportional increase ?

The full set of data used for this project is available on kaggle and is made available for public use.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

All the analysis has been made available in a single file that has been prepared using the kaggle notebooks. Markdown cells make it easier to follow through the project and questions have been presented with separate categories.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@muhammadmubashirmahmood/has-netflix-been-adding-more-tv-content-over-the-years-6227a6dac8f4).



## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to the kaggle community as well as specifically mention Shivam Bansai, Dhruv Gangwani and AndresHG whose specific framework made it easier to create helpful visulations. The data of the project is available at https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows
